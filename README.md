# CUDA Programming Course
This repository is for systematic way of learning CUDA Programming on GPU. 
The repository contains solved examples along with major concepts planned across various weeks.

The whole course has been divided into multiple weeks, each covering major topics in details.

# Following are the weekly topic covered in this course:
* Week 1 - CUDA Intro, Threads, Blocks
* Week 2 - Grids, Shared Memory, Reduction Pattern
* Week 3 - 2D Block, Grids, Matrices
* Week 5 - Atomics Operations
* Week 6 - Streams, Integrated Memory
* Week 7 - Advanced Tiling, Threads Collaboration
* Week 8 - Warp Concepts, Sparse Matrices
* Week 9 - CUDA libraries cuBLAS, cuDNN
* Week 10 - Sorting, Parallel Merge
* Week 11 - Graph algorithms, BFS, Graph traversal
