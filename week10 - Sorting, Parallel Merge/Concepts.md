# Sorting


## Sorting methods
* Comparison based - Merge Sort, Odd-Even Sort, Bitonic Sort
* Non-comparison based - Radix Sort

Radix sort can achieve lower time complexity than other sorting algorithms like merge sorts, bitonic sorts because it is noncomparison sorting method. 
However, radix sort can only be applied to sorting with certain types of keys. Other comparison based sorting methods like merge sort and bitonic 
sort can be used with any types of keys that has well defined comparison operator.
